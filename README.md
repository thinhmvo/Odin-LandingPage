# Objective

This project was created for me to learn HTML and CSS. It marks the very beginning of my journey as a software developer.

## What I Have Learned

I have learned how to use flexbox in CSS, which allows me to create attractive and well-structured layouts for web pages

This project has reinforced my passion for software development and problem-solving

There's an incredible feeling that comes with figuring out how things work, manipulating elements on the page, and seeing the changes in real-time (thanks to the Live Server extension in VSCode)

It's truly an amazing experience.
